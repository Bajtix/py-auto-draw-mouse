# Auto Draw
### auto drawing script in python

file has to be an SVG path. Examples included. Kinda cursed tho :)

Install by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and run
```
ds.py file [--scale=4] [--samples=4]
```

the code is slow, it sucks, etc. i don't care. I've just drawn several jerma faces everywhere.
have fun
