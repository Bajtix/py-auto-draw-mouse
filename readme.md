# Auto Draw
auto drawing script in python
<br>

File has to be an SVG path. Examples included. Kinda cursed tho :)
You can add a picture by using Inkscape and it's XML editor (select the path and the string called 'd'. Copy it's contents, voila!)
## Install
Make sure you have python! (tested with python 3.9)
Clone the repo, then install dependencies by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
after that run the script
```
ds.py file [--scale=4] [--samples=4]
```

the code is slow, it sucks, etc. i don't care. I've just drawn several jerma faces everywhere.
have fun
